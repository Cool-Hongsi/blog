## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
There is a bunch of ways to optimize search engine in this moment such as Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Google Search Console etc.
I would like to introduce One of the SEO which is Google Search Console. It enable to show up in google search engine once it registered.
(However, Google Search Console can not deal with Title & Description & Site Link directly.)

### Process

1. Search Google Search Conosle
> - Add Property - URL Prefix - Input Domain

2. Require Certification
> - Recommend easiest ways to get certification (Google Analytics & HTML Tag)
>> - Google Analytics - Sign up - Track Code - Copy gtag.js and paste it into head tag
>> - HTML Tag - Copy meta tag and paste it into head tag

3. Submit Sitemap
> - Sitemap is essential for the SEO, helping search robots better to gather website information.
A roadmap-type file (.xml) is called a sitemap.
> - Basically, there are many websites that are using sitemap, but if you use them,
    Whenever you modify the content of a website, Sitemap also has the hassle of modifying and uploading (FTP).
    If you created a website using Wordpress, even if you modified the content of the website, you do not have to re-upload Sitemap
    since there is a plug-in that automatically and periodically updates the above tasks. (Google XML Sitemaps or Yoast)
> - Copy ~.xml attached domain name and paste it into google search console.

4. Configurate from Google Search Console

5. Check Performance and Report with Actual URL Test
